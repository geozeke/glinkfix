# Google Drive Link Fixer

## A note to developers

If you're just using glinkfix, then carry on!

If you're a developer looking to fork this repository and modify glinkfix,
there are two important considerations:

1. glinkfix requires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency
   management. Poetry is well behaved and if you're a Python developer you
   should check it out. It installs itself in a virtual environment, uninstalls
   cleanly and easily, and doesn't require `sudo` for installation. Visit the
   [poetry site](https://python-poetry.org/) and install it using the
   instructions for your operating system.

   *Note: When you install poetry, pay careful attention to the message printed
   by the poetry installer. It provides details on how to modify `$PATH` to
   access the poetry runtime.*

2. I've included a file called `global-gitignore.txt` which is a copy of the
   `.gitignore` I placed in my home directory and configured globally for all
   my development projects. The `global-gitignore.txt` file reflects my
   development setup (for example using tools like vscode), but yours may be
   different. Just cherry-pick any necessary elements from
   `global-gitignore.txt` for your own use.

   *Details on gitignore files are available on
   [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files).*

## Installation

The Google Drive Link Fixer is lightweight, pure Python, with no third-party
dependencies.

```text
pip3 install glinkfix  
```

or

```text
poetry add glinkfix
```

## Purpose / Usage

When you share files with Google Drive, the sharing link you get is only good
for accessing the content through a web browser. If you want to use a Google
Drive sharing link to embed an image in a document (e.g. in a markdown or html
file), or you want to directly download a file pointed-to by a Google Drive
sharing link using something like `curl` or `wget` in linux, the link needs to
be adjusted ("fixed") for these purposes.

It's not especially hard to repackage the link, but it's a pain. You have to
copy the link to a text editor, carve it up manually, and reassemble it. If
you've got a lot of links to deal with it starts to get very tedious. This tool
is designed to remove the tedium.

*Note: The animated gifs below are actually hosted on Google Drive and the
"fixed" links are embedded into this README file.*

---

Start by getting a sharing link to a file on Google Drive. Make sure it's set
up for public access (*Anyone with the link*):

![Retrieving Google Link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1BJ5cR04cSzHa4xMIPApjLXv0IHPDu9U2)

---

Now run `glinkfix` and paste the link into the terminal. Copy the "fixed"
version and use is as required.

---

To display the help menu, run: `glinkfix -h`

```text
usage: glinkfix [-h] (-v | -d)

This program takes a Google Drive sharing link for a file and repackages it into a link
that can be downloaded directly (e.g. using curl) or embedded in a document to be viewed
(e.g. an image in a markdown document). Note: there is a size limit of 40MB for a single
file when using Google Drive links in this manner.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -v, --view      repackage the link for viewing (e.g. as an embedded link in a markdown
                  document).
  -d, --download  repackage the link for downloading (e.g. downloading using curl).
```

## Usage Notes

* There is a 40MB size limit for a single file when using Google Drive sharing
  links directly for viewing or downloading. Individual files larger than 40MB
  will not render/download properly. This limit is a function of how Google
  Drive works and is not related to `glinkfix`.
* When creating a download link for use with `curl` make sure to use `curl`'s
  `-L` option to allow for redirects.
* `glinkfix` supports links that use Google's [resource
  key](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10685032) security feature.
